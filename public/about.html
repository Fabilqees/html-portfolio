<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Bilqees Onize Ibrahim, Currently working as a grade 1 mathematics teacher. I studied Biological sciences.
  If I were to describe myself in 3 words it would be that <strong>Funny, Generous</strong> and <strong>Beautiful</strong>
</p>

<p>My coding journey started not from passion if I am being honest, but as I keep learning I find it very intersting and amazing how things are built and how they work. I don't have to be just the user anymore
  I am now a builder and developer, you have no idea how happy I am about this. Honestly I can't wait to build stuff and work with creative minds.
</p>

<p>My hobbies other than coding are reading, singing, enjoying nature, enjoying family time, watching sitcoms, animations and action movies and most times when I can help it, being happy.</p>
